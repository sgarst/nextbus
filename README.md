nextbus
=======

Prototype SEPTA bus application, potential for IOT device displaying next bus to arrive at stop [X].
YASA - Yet another SEPTA application. 

Planning a simple, cheap and dedicated device that would simply display real-time estimate of when the next bus will arrive at a specified stop. Potentially show several bus routes for the same stop. This is just the backend prototype as a web app.
